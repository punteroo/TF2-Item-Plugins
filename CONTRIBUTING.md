# Contributing

If you're willing to change the codebase be it for any reason you are welcome to do so. The plugins' functionality isn't really well coded in due to SourcePawn's limitations (and probably my small brain, yes I'd say that is the issue here) and might present some opportunities for better performance / fixes.

You **may** instantiate a Pull Request for changes to functionality if at least one of the following conditions apply:
- You have found an exploit/bug on any of the plugins (and fixed it).
- You have made performance changes.
- You have written translations.
   - Any language is welcome as long as its supported by SourceMod.
- You have made improvements or added new functionalities.

If none of these apply to your case you may still open a PR, everything's up for discussion this project isn't that big to begin with and I'd love to see some PRs appear!
