//	 This configuration file is utilized to manage the plugins' behaivour. All commands utilized by VIP members of your community
//	will be here. I'll spit some information about what the plugin does and how to use this CFG file correctly as well.
//
//	 This plugin is a fast and easy menu utilized to concise all VIP / Donator commands into one. It is highly customizable and
//	stable, it is optimized to not lag any server on its usage. You can customize the menu's title, options, descriptions, etc.
//	 I've made an example configuration below (you must modify it at your liking) for you to check out how everything works and
//	how to change what. Keep in mind, the limit of commands by default is 30. This can be changed in the plugins' code.
//	 Here are all the effect attributes cause on the plugin (i planned more but they're unnecesary for now :3):
//
//	command			- The command the user executes once he selects that option. If it's a command whose case is similar to the noclip one
//					explained above, then leave it blank. If it's left blank no command will be executed on the user.
//
//	level			- Determines the VIP "level" to use that command (or have it even listed). It is currently disabled as it will not be
//					used.
